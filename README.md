## Notes
A valid OpenWeatherMap API key shall be obtained and maintained in an environment variable *OWM_APP_ID* before running the application.
* When running the application locally, maintain an API key in the configuration file *.env*.
* When deploying the application to SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry, maintain an API key in Cloud Foundry deployment manifest *manifest.xml*.
